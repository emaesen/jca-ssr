      "details": "‚Äú[The Riverside](https://www.theriversidefolk.com/) is a traditional melodic and harmony-driven folk string band hailing from Southern California, founded by husband and wife Jake and Lorien Jeanson in 2012. The highly engaging four-piece dynamically performs around one microphone, where each instrument and voice crafts a specific part of each story; creating intimate, savory folk music that warms the heart and feeds the soul.‚Äù -Nicholas Edward Williams | Earthtone Booking-\n\nThe Riverside originated in Southern California where founding member, Jacob Jeanson (songwriter & guitar), was attending Westmont College in 2012. In his senior year, the band formed in hopes of winning Santa Barbara‚Äôs battle of the bands. As an energetic and engaging folk band with foot stomping musical companions, the group was able to win the competition and release their first album with the winnings.\n\nIn the following years, Jake got to play with many talented friends and personalities which helped mold the band‚Äôs vision and created time to grow in tasteful and intentional songwriting; a nostalgic yet refreshing charm that leads listeners across a grand frontier of warm and beautiful scenery.\n\nHowever, the band was able to make the jump to full time when his wife Lorien Jeanson (mandolin & harmony) was added to the lineup. Lorien is originally from  the redwood forest and farmlands of Northern California, but ended up attending the same college as Jake, where they met and fell in love.\n\nThe duo swiftly began touring with a rotating cast of friends; playing in theaters, venues, festivals, and living room concerts across the United States. Regardless of their current friend lineup, the group aims to create a magical and organic vibe which translates into the feeling of the music, often singing and playing around a single old fashioned microphone,  seamlessly blending the musical composition of their harmonies and instruments. Since 2012, the band has released 4 homegrown records and an EP, with more songs and albums in the works.\n\nGrowing up and being raised listening to the likes of The Eagles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Jake and Lorien grew an appreciation and aim for group harmonies and heartfelt authenticity , while also striving to be amazing live performers like their modern influences , a few being  Fleet Foxes, Mandolin Orange, and The Head and the Heart.\n\nCurrent Line Up:\n\nJake Jeanson - Guitar, Vocals, Kick Drum, Tambourine\n\nLorien Jeanson - Mandolin, Vocals\n\nJames Page - Standup Bass, Vocals\n\nChase Fierro - Fiddle\n\nTrey Lindsley -  Banjo, Vocals\n\nKristen Posey - Cello, Vocals",

Six spellers enter; one speller leaves! At least the losers get a juice box.\n\nDirected by Kale Coppin\n\nChoreographed by Wendy James",

      "details": "[THE BROTHERS REED](http://www.thebrothersreed.com/)\nWith their comedic brotherly banter, impeccable harmonic expression, and widely varying influences, a Brothers Reed performance will have you reflecting on lost lives and lovers, laughing hysterically and leaving completely entertained.\n\nThe duo incorporates harmonica, percussion, into their live performances, soothing your soul with songs that are familiar yet original. Whether they are finger picking their way through a lamentable ballad or bringing you around full-speed with a barn-burning bluegrass number, The Brothers Reed are masters of their craft.\n\nDespite their brotherhood, Aaron and Phil Reed didn‚Äôt start playing music together until five years ago after Phil left their hometown of St. Charles, Missouri to join Aaron in the unsullied mountains of the American Northwest. The brothers family blend of folk encapsulates the grit and humor of Midwest life with the swagger and serenity of the west coast. Their style evokes finger picking folk singers of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs with a contemporary and boundless edge. Cultivated from years of performing in bands ranging from heavy metal to reggae and rock, to punk, country, and funk, their musical dichotomy is at the root of their diverse yet seamless folk-brand.\n\nThrough an exhaustive tour schedule that includes nearly 300 shows per year, the Brothers Reed have quickly risen to regional renown and tour extensively throughout the U.S. With three studio albums released (Sick As Folk, 2015; Monster In My Head, 2016; Three, 2018) a full band live release (Live at the Buckhunters Ball: Callahan, CA, 2017), and the latest ‚ÄúCaught in a Dream‚Äù 2019, The Bros show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",

      "details": "For nearly four decades, [Laurie Lewis](https://laurielewis.com/) has gathered fans and honors for her powerful and emotive voice and her versatile, dynamic songwriting. She is a sought-after recording producer and an equally skilled teacher and mentor. And she is an inspiration and a ground-breaker ‚Äì across genres, across geography and across gender barriers. Laurie has shown us how a woman can blend into any part of the classic bluegrass singing trio, and she showed us how a great voice could move fluidly between bluegrass and other types of music. She showed us how a female fiddler could emulate the strength and grit of the early bluegrass musicians. She has shown how a Californian can appeal to traditional bluegrass audiences, as well as winning acclaim in the worlds of Americana and folk music.\n\nShe has shown us how to lead bands of talented musicians ‚Äì learning from them while helping them make their best music. And she has shown us how to thrive in a constantly changing musical environment ‚Äì without ever sacrificing her art.\n\n\n ![Laurie Lewis](laurie-lewis-2.jpg) Although she has played roots music since her teenage years and performed in various bands from her early 20s, it wasn‚Äôt until she was 36 that Laurie decided to venture out on her own. Her solo recording, Restless Rambling Heart, introduced the national music audience to Laurie‚Äôs talents and versatility. The CD, produced by Tim O‚ÄôBrien, features seven originals and showcases her stunning vocal range and control.\n\nSince that time, Laurie has twice been named Female Vocalist of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and won Song of the Year for her rendition of the now-standard ‚ÄúWho Will Watch the Home Place?‚Äù She has collaborated on numerous other award-winning recordings.\n\nWhile steeped in the bluegrass tradition, Laurie‚Äôs songwriting demonstrates her ability to surpass the limitations of that genre. Her works reflect her wide range of influences: from old time and country to Tin Pan Alley, jazz standards and early rock ‚Äòn roll.\n\nHer songs have been recorded by Kathy Mattea, Patsy Montana and the First Ladies of Bluegrass, led by Missy Raines, among others.\n\nPoet, essayist, novelist, and environmental activist Wendell Berry has asked her to set some of his poems to music.\n\nLaurie has been nominated for GRAMMYs for her own projects and has been prominently featured on others‚Äô GRAMMY-winning works.",

      "details": "[Twisted Pine](https://www.twistedpineband.com/) has quickly become one of the most acclaimed young string bands in the Northeast. Audiences across the US and UK have been drawn to their forthright songwriting, lush harmonies, musical daring, and charismatic appeal.\n\nSteeped in traditional music, these musicians are also fearless, tuneful improvisers and passionate lovers of pop. Fiddler Kathleen Parks' command of the vocal mic is as charming as it is gutsy. On her instrument, Parks is an insatiable risk-taker, seeking out exciting new musical territories. Mandolinist Dan Bui is a master of melody and drive, celebrated widely for his dexterous, tasteful picking. And bassist Chris Sartori holds down the low end and a lot more, introducing creative, funk-inflected cadences that never overwhelm the beat.\n\nBut while it‚Äôs easy to celebrate each of the band members individually, Twisted Pine is more than a collection of talented musicians - it‚Äôs a unit that grooves together. Their intricate arrangements of swelling, syncopated rhythm and precise instrumental interplay bring the enveloping sound and hooks of indie pop to an acoustic instrumental setting.\n\nYou‚Äôll find Twisted Pine on stages large and small, entertaining festivals of thousands and intimate rooms alike. Winners of the 2018 Boston Music Award's Americana Artist of the Year and selected as one of Improper Bostonian's 2018 ‚ÄúTop 10 Local Acts on the Rise‚Äù, Twisted Pine has played major events from Grey Fox to DelFest to Glasgow‚Äôs Celtic Connections and beyond. ‚ÄúThey absolutely rule their musical world with humor and relish,‚Äù says legendary fiddler Darol Anger.",

The Cat in the Hat guides us into The Jungle of Nool where we see Horton, the kind hearted elephant who discovers a speck of dust containing Whoville. He meets JoJo, a Who child sent to military school for thinking too many ‚Äúthinks.‚Äù Horton decides he must protect the speck of dust on a nearby clover, while at the same time protecting an abandoned egg left to his care by the lazy Mayzie la Bird. Horton tries to convince the other animals in The Jungle of the existence of the Whos, but he is ridiculed and put on trial for insanity. Only his loyal neighbor, Gertrude McFuzz, never loses faith in him. Eventually, the two fall in love. Now one of the most widely produced musicals in the country, Seussical weaves a story of friendship, loyalty, and love. Despite all odds, Horton and Gertrude band together to save the Whos, free Horton, and restore peace and unity to the Jungle of Nool. Charming Seussical teaches us the power of being unique, and the importance of fighting for your beliefs.",

Using a combination of magic and common sense, she must teach the family members how to value each other again. Mary Poppins takes the children on many magical and memorable adventures, but Jane and Michael aren't the only ones upon whom she has a profound effect. Even grown-ups can learn a lesson or two from the nanny who advises that ‚ÄúAnything can happen if you let it.‚Äù\n\nFun for all ages! Kids 10 and under are free :)\n\nDisney and Cameron Mackintosh's Mary Poppins JR. is an enchanting mixture of irresistible story, unforgettable songs and breathtaking dance numbers.",

There will be no cost to participants and pre-registration is not necessary.\n\nIn the singer-songwriter tradition, participants are encouraged to bring a guitar, ukulele, or other instruments to accompany their songs. A piano will also be available. Attendees may also bring songs they‚Äôve written to read or sing without musical accompaniment if they prefer.\n\n\n**Merle Anderson**, a local amateur songwriter, has volunteered to host the circle for JCA. Anderson says the circle will not be a class about songwriting, although discussion about the art of songwriting and personal inspiration will be encouraged. The circle will provide an incentive for singers and writers to write and debut new songs with fellow songwriters. Writers with professional experience are also invited to share their songs and inspire others.\n\n\n**Wendy James**, director of JCA, says that the center is excited to host the songwriter circle as part of its mission to serve as a hub for arts in the area. The workshop was originally proposed last year but had to be postponed due to the pandemic.

Whether they are finger picking their way through a lamentable ballad or bringing you around full-speed with a barn-burning bluegrass number, The Brothers Reed are masters of their craft.\n\nDespite their brotherhood, Aaron and Phil Reed didn‚Äôt start playing music together until five years ago after Phil left their hometown of St. Charles, Missouri to join Aaron in the unsullied mountains of the American Northwest. The brothers family blend of folk encapsulates the grit and humor of Midwest life with the swagger and serenity of the west coast. Their style evokes finger picking folk singers of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs with a contemporary and boundless edge. Cultivated from years of performing in bands ranging from heavy metal to reggae and rock, to punk, country, and funk, their musical dichotomy is at the root of their diverse yet seamless folk-brand.\n\nThrough an exhaustive tour schedule that includes nearly 300 shows per year, the Brothers Reed have quickly risen to regional renown and tour extensively throughout the U.S. With three studio albums released (Sick As Folk, 2015; Monster In My Head, 2016; Three, 2018) a full band live release (Live at the Buckhunters Ball: Callahan, CA, 2017), and the latest ‚ÄúCaught in a Dream‚Äù 2019, The Bros show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\n[KEVIN PATRICK RADLEY](https://www.facebook.com/KPRtheHollar) is a singer songwriter from Vallejo, CA. He draws his musical influences from the American musical landscape of blues, country, soul and the occasional country holler. His songs explore time honored themes of love, loss and redemption and performed in the spirit of the juke joint jam. He has played at number of venues throughout Northern California including; The Brick & Mortar & Bazaar Caf√©, The Lost Church, San Francisco Bay Area Blues Festival , Down Home Music in El Cerrito, CA.

      "details": "[George Jackson](https://www.georgejacksonmusic.com/) is a Nashville-based old-time and bluegrass fiddler. Born in New Zealand, George grew up in a musical family and first heard bluegrass music around the age of 14, immediately falling in love with the style he started trying to work out how to play it from recordings and from the few mentors he could find in New Zealand. As a resident of Nashville and the USA from 2016, George released an album of original old-time style fiddle tunes, ‚ÄúTime and Place‚Äù in 2019 to acclaim. He was awarded the 2019 Mike Auldridge composition award by the DC bluegrass union for his tune ‚ÄúChapel Hill Deer Stalk‚Äù and sparked a viral fiddle tune with his composition ‚ÄúDorrigo‚Äù, with hundreds of musicians learning the tune and posting videos of themselves playing it online, becoming known as the ‚Äú#dorrigochallenge‚Äù. Each track on ‚ÄúTime and Place‚Äù is written by George and named for its time and place of composition, tracing his journey from New Zealand to his new life in the United States, exploring ideas of authenticity and identity through fiddle music.\n\n[Cameron DeWhitt](https://www.camerondewhitt.com/) is a banjoist and Old Time musician living in Portland, Oregon. He hosts the weekly podcast Get Up in the Cool: Old Time Music with Cameron DeWhitt and Friends, which features conversations and musical collaborations with today‚Äôs most influential traditional musicians. As the host of Get Up in the Cool, Cameron has applied his idiosyncratic clawhammer banjo technique to many traditional musics, from old time Appalachian and bluegrass to M√©tis, Scandinavian, Acadian, Irish, and New Mexican, to name a few. As a performer, he curates a unique musical experience featuring his favorite findings (and creations) uncovered during his interminable bouts of curiosity. ‚ÄúCameron DeWhitt, at the age of 28 [is] already among the finest clawhammer banjo players alive.‚Äù ‚Äî R.D.

      "details": "[Twisted Pine](https://www.twistedpineband.com/) has quickly become one of the most acclaimed young string bands in the Northeast. Audiences across the US and UK have been drawn to their forthright songwriting, lush harmonies, musical daring, and charismatic appeal.\n\nSteeped in traditional music, these musicians are also fearless, tuneful improvisers and passionate lovers of pop. Fiddler Kathleen Parks' command of the vocal mic is as charming as it is gutsy. On her instrument, Parks is an insatiable risk-taker, seeking out exciting new musical territories. Mandolinist Dan Bui is a master of melody and drive, celebrated widely for his dexterous, tasteful picking. And bassist Chris Sartori holds down the low end and a lot more, introducing creative, funk-inflected cadences that never overwhelm the beat.\n\nBut while it‚Äôs easy to celebrate each of the band members individually, Twisted Pine is more than a collection of talented musicians - it‚Äôs a unit that grooves together. Their intricate arrangements of swelling, syncopated rhythm and precise instrumental interplay bring the enveloping sound and hooks of indie pop to an acoustic instrumental setting.\n\nYou‚Äôll find Twisted Pine on stages large and small, entertaining festivals of thousands and intimate rooms alike. Winners of the 2018 Boston Music Award's Americana Artist of the Year and selected as one of Improper Bostonian's 2018 ‚ÄúTop 10 Local Acts on the Rise‚Äù, Twisted Pine has played major events from Grey Fox to DelFest to Glasgow‚Äôs Celtic Connections and beyond. ‚ÄúThey absolutely rule their musical world with humor and relish,‚Äù says legendary fiddler Darol Anger.\n\nTwisted Pine released its debut, self-titled album of original music in 2017, followed in 2018 by Dreams, an EP of ‚Äúwildly innovative covers‚Ä¶ full of spark, light, and irresistible force‚Äù according to PopMatters. Check out Twisted Pine on tour and see why the Boston Globe calls them ‚Äúa wider version of stringband, boundary jumpers akin to outfits like Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek, and Crooked Still.‚Äù",
