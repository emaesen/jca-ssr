There will be no cost to participants and pre-registration is not necessary.\n\nIn the singer-songwriter tradition, participants are encouraged to bring a guitar, ukulele, or other instruments to accompany their songs. A piano will also be available. Attendees may also bring songs they’ve written to read or sing without musical accompaniment if they prefer.\n\n\n**Merle Anderson**, a local amateur songwriter, has volunteered to host the circle for JCA. Anderson says the circle will not be a class about songwriting, although discussion about the art of songwriting and personal inspiration will be encouraged. The circle will provide an incentive for singers and writers to write and debut new songs with fellow songwriters. Writers with professional experience are also invited to share their songs and inspire others.\n\n\n**Wendy James**, director of JCA, says that the center is excited to host the songwriter circle as part of its mission to serve as a hub for arts in the area. The workshop was originally proposed last year but had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Depending on the level of interest, the circle may be extended as a monthly or quarterly series of songwriter workshops.",

That is [Jimbo Scott](https://jimboscottmusic.com)’s voice – a bell, magnetic and the definition of a powerhouse. A favorite in the Bay Area’s esteemed house concert scene and folk venues, Jimbo’s combines the influences of his birthplace of Memphis, TN and his life-long home in the San Francisco Bay Area, His songs evoke traditions of Tennessee country and bluegrass, Oakland soul and sepia toned California landscapes and life-scapes. Like a spinning mirror, Jimbo’s music casts reflections around the room, flashing from honest self-deprecation to cinematic retrospectives on our part in shaping our communities and accounting the consequences of our actions and inactions.\n\nJimbo Scott has honed his skills in the last 2 years as a member of the famed Bay Area bluegrass jam band Poor Man’s Whiskey. His performances with the band at The Kate Wolf Music Festival and the Fillmore, among countless other events, helped to draw attention to his solo work. With Poor Man’s Whiskey announcing a hiatus at the end of 2019, Jimbo aims to seize on the momentum of the last two years and invite the loyal PMW fanbase as well as folk and americana fans far and wide to enjoy his own musical contributions.\n\nIf you like Zach Brown, Tracy Chapman, The John Butler Trio or Jason Isbell, then you will love Jimbo Scott!\n\n“Jimbo Scott stops the room with his voice and hearts with his words. I love every chance I get to see him live!” – KC Turner\n\n“Jimbo Scott is the real deal!! His baritone vocals take you to the streets of Greenwich Village, to the hills of Scotland, down South through Memphis and back again to his hometown of Oakland, California. Dave Van Ronk meets Reverend Gary Davis, a modern folk singer with a revolutionary spirit and a heart of gold.” – Josh Brough of Poor Man’s Whiskey",

Whether they are finger picking their way through a lamentable ballad or bringing you around full-speed with a barn-burning bluegrass number, The Brothers Reed are masters of their craft.\n\nDespite their brotherhood, Aaron and Phil Reed didn’t start playing music together until five years ago after Phil left their hometown of St. Charles, Missouri to join Aaron in the unsullied mountains of the American Northwest. The brothers family blend of folk encapsulates the grit and humor of Midwest life with the swagger and serenity of the west coast. Their style evokes finger picking folk singers of the 60’s and 70’s with a contemporary and boundless edge. Cultivated from years of performing in bands ranging from heavy metal to reggae and rock, to punk, country, and funk, their musical dichotomy is at the root of their diverse yet seamless folk-brand.\n\nThrough an exhaustive tour schedule that includes nearly 300 shows per year, the Brothers Reed have quickly risen to regional renown and tour extensively throughout the U.S. With three studio albums released (Sick As Folk, 2015; Monster In My Head, 2016; Three, 2018) a full band live release (Live at the Buckhunters Ball: Callahan, CA, 2017), and the latest “Caught in a Dream” 2019, The Bros show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\n[KEVIN PATRICK RADLEY](https://www.facebook.com/KPRtheHollar) is a singer songwriter from Vallejo, CA. He draws his musical influences from the American musical landscape of blues, country, soul and the occasional country holler. His songs explore time honored themes of love, loss and redemption and performed in the spirit of the juke joint jam.

Born in New Zealand, George grew up in a musical family and first heard bluegrass music around the age of 14, immediately falling in love with the style he started trying to work out how to play it from recordings and from the few mentors he could find in New Zealand. As a resident of Nashville and the USA from 2016, George released an album of original old-time style fiddle tunes, “Time and Place” in 2019 to acclaim. He was awarded the 2019 Mike Auldridge composition award by the DC bluegrass union for his tune “Chapel Hill Deer Stalk” and sparked a viral fiddle tune with his composition “Dorrigo”, with hundreds of musicians learning the tune and posting videos of themselves playing it online, becoming known as the “#dorrigochallenge”. Each track on “Time and Place” is written by George and named for its time and place of composition, tracing his journey from New Zealand to his new life in the United States, exploring ideas of authenticity and identity through fiddle music.\n\n[Cameron DeWhitt](https://www.camerondewhitt.com/) is a banjoist and Old Time musician living in Portland, Oregon. He hosts the weekly podcast Get Up in the Cool: Old Time Music with Cameron DeWhitt and Friends, which features conversations and musical collaborations with today’s most influential traditional musicians. As the host of Get Up in the Cool, Cameron has applied his idiosyncratic clawhammer banjo technique to many traditional musics, from old time Appalachian and bluegrass to Métis, Scandinavian, Acadian, Irish, and New Mexican, to name a few. As a performer, he curates a unique musical experience featuring his favorite findings (and creations) uncovered during his interminable bouts of curiosity. “Cameron DeWhitt, at the age of 28 [is] already among the finest clawhammer banjo players alive.” — R.D.

      "details": "[Twisted Pine](https://www.twistedpineband.com/) has quickly become one of the most acclaimed young string bands in the Northeast. Audiences across the US and UK have been drawn to their forthright songwriting, lush harmonies, musical daring, and charismatic appeal.\n\nSteeped in traditional music, these musicians are also fearless, tuneful improvisers and passionate lovers of pop. Fiddler Kathleen Parks' command of the vocal mic is as charming as it is gutsy. On her instrument, Parks is an insatiable risk-taker, seeking out exciting new musical territories. Mandolinist Dan Bui is a master of melody and drive, celebrated widely for his dexterous, tasteful picking. And bassist Chris Sartori holds down the low end and a lot more, introducing creative, funk-inflected cadences that never overwhelm the beat.\n\nBut while it’s easy to celebrate each of the band members individually, Twisted Pine is more than a collection of talented musicians - it’s a unit that grooves together. Their intricate arrangements of swelling, syncopated rhythm and precise instrumental interplay bring the enveloping sound and hooks of indie pop to an acoustic instrumental setting.\n\nYou’ll find Twisted Pine on stages large and small, entertaining festivals of thousands and intimate rooms alike. Winners of the 2018 Boston Music Award's Americana Artist of the Year and selected as one of Improper Bostonian's 2018 “Top 10 Local Acts on the Rise”, Twisted Pine has played major events from Grey Fox to DelFest to Glasgow’s Celtic Connections and beyond. “They absolutely rule their musical world with humor and relish,” says legendary fiddler Darol Anger.\n\nTwisted Pine released its debut, self-titled album of original music in 2017, followed in 2018 by Dreams, an EP of “wildly innovative covers… full of spark, light, and irresistible force” according to PopMatters. Check out Twisted Pine on tour and see why the Boston Globe calls them “a wider version of stringband, boundary jumpers akin to outfits like Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek, and Crooked Still.”",

With the foundation of Greg’s unique banjo playing style, Rick Faris (guitar), Nate Burie (mandolin), and Dan Eubanks (bass) effortlessly support each other and consistently maintain their bluegrass center whether they’re playing a jazz-tinged instrumental or a song from their award-winning John Denver tribute album while consistently maintaining their bluegrass center. These four talented vocalists and instrumentalists follow their creative desires without straying too far from their roots.​\n\n‘Rivers and Roads’, the band’s 19th recording, was nominated for a 2019 Grammy, received five 2018 IBMA nominations, and was awarded Album of the Year. The tune “Squirrel Hunters” from that recording received the Instrumental Recorded Performance of the Year award.\n\nThe energetic Special C show features Rick’s high, emotional singing and inspirational guitar playing and Nate’s powerful voice and creative mandolin playing which provide the formidable counter to Greg’s driving banjo and Dan’s impressive bass playing that holds everything together and reflects his bluegrass, country and jazz performance experience. Their voices blend seamlessly.\n\nInternational tours have brought the band to Canada, Europe, South America, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The band has appeared on National Public Radio, The Nashville Network, the Grand Ole Opry at the historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and in concert with symphony orchestras nationwide.\n\nDedicated to preserving their craft as well as keeping it fresh, in 1984 Special Consensus initiated the Traditional American Music (TAM) Program, to introduce bluegrass music to students in schools across the country and in several foreign lands.\n\nSpecial C’s continued success is a testament to their adaptability and contemporary appeal.

They're joined by fiddler Craig Judelman (USA/DE), whose deep background and natural familiarity with old time American music (Jewish and non) provides the perfect counterpoint, along with Mr. Sklamberg accordion, for these two voices. This small all star band packs a big punch, charming audiences with the stories of the Ashkenazic experience that range from intimate to revelatory.\n\nThis concert is much more than a collection of songs - the performers are also skilled storytellers, using the songs to give the audience a greater understanding of the culture and context that created them.",
