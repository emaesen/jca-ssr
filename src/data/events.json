She seems indifferent to the spectacular beauty around her, near the base of Mount Shasta. “There’s a lot of purpose in those legs,” one of the men remarks. They assume she is looking for gold, as they are, but conclude that the important thing is what she and they are walking towards. Freedom. It’s the opening scene of an hour-long movie, “The Golden Ghosts,” the latest work by Mt Shasta artist and filmmaker Mark Oliver’s project to recover the forgotten history of African Americans’ participation in the California Gold Rush. Funded by the 18th St Art Center in Santa Monica and the California Arts Council Oliver picked a local group of actors who you will recognize, Clue=one plays the saxophone! It is a historical fiction work based on Siskiyou County events.\n\n[Buy advance tickets on Mark Oliver’s website](https://markoliver.org/events)",

This collaboration, a pickup band of sorts, features four such thrill seekers - four artful musicians at the top of their game, eager to make some magic together as they embark on their first performances together.\n\nThe band isn’t completely without a foundation, as Colin Cotter (vox / guitar) and Sumaia Jackson (5-string fiddle) gig together as a duo, performing Sumaia’s original tunes, Colin’s original songs, and music from the Celtic & American folk traditions. Joining them are Tristan Clarridge (cello) and Anna Colliton (bodhrán), two of the finest musicians around whose creative instincts create endless marvelous possibilities. This band will take you on quite a journey as they shift from blazing fiddle tunes to beautiful slow songs, sing silky vocal harmony, pull off tightly arranged pieces, and let loose with improvised solos and spontaneously crafted arrangements, all the while sharing the joy of organic interplay between musicians openly expressing in the moment.",

Russel may be one of the first Asian American artists to produce his own work with the critically acclaimed recording “Hisashi” in 1978. In 1992 he produced “Earth Prayer” which features pianist Andrew Hill and in 1999 “Spirit Drum- Taiko Stories From America” with Jeanne Mercer, Masato Baba, and Shoji Kameda. In 2010 he recorded “Tadaima” and “KorewaKorewa” which features original work with Jeanne Mercer and Masato Baba. Baba “not only plays conventional items such as the alto saxophone, but a variety of ethnic instruments from all over the world. Even when Baba plays the alto, he gives it an eerie other-worldly quality that puts the music right into the twilight zone ...a daring approach to the music, a worthwhile deviation from the norm.” ~ San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Tadaima!” - “now, at present / I am here! / I am home!” - is a traditional Japanese announcement when one comes home.\n\nRussel Baba and Jeanne Mercer founded Shasta Taiko in 1985 and ShastaYama, an annual summer outdoor taiko/music festival at the base of majestic Mount Shasta in 2005\n\n*Jeanne Aiko Mercer* is a recognized and honored American taiko pioneer.

Her taiko compositions are the center of Shasta Taiko’s repertoire and are considered “classic” in modern American taiko.\nShe leads workshops with Russel Baba at national, regional, and collegiate conferences in taiko and improvisation.\nMercer has collaborated and performed original work with Russel Baba and jazz artists - Eddie Moore, Michael White, Andrew Hill, Gary Fitzgerald, Mark Izu, Makoto Horiuchi; taiko artists - Seiichi Tanaka, Kenny Endo, Masato Baba, San Jose Taiko, Portland Taiko, and On Ensemble; Japanese butoh dancer Koichi Tamano; writer Lawson Inada; and painter Hisako Hibi.\nShe has contributed to movie soundtracks – Star Wars and Apocalypse Now, and is featured on recordings by Russel Baba  – Hisashi, Spirit Drum, Tadaima, and Korewakorewa.\n\n*Gary Fitzgerald* is known for his dynamic bass sound, creative spontaneity, and a unique writing approach.\nGary has performed and recorded original music with jazz artists - wind player Russel Baba, drummer Eddie Moore, violinist Michael White, drummer E.

      "details": "#The Secret Beach# Everyone loves a secret: a shortcut through the woods, a fishing hole, a beach.\n\n![Micah Erenberg](micah-erenberg-m.jpg)I’m at [the Secret Beach](https://www.thesecretbeach.ca/) now, and I’m reminded that it’s been years since Micah Erenberg merged into the rocks and trees and sand that line this endless spine of a beach – a beach that arches out of an inland ocean like a giant waking from a marshy sleep. How he did this, I can’t tell you. But it came to him as if by revelation: if place is being, then you must become that place: become the Secret Beach: become a firmament for sunny summer days: become a place where you feel like you belong, a place that reminds you of home, a place that is home. And so he became the beach. This is what the Songs from Secret Beach do, too – they can shatter and scatter you into the winds, they can peer into you as if you were glass, they can weather the edges of your broken bottles. And they allow for others – like me – to reflect. You can hear them easier out here. Listen. Put your ears to the ground. Do you hear it? Each grain of sand sings a secret song. Each one is no less important than another. I hear billions around me. A chorus of melodies swarm along the shoreline. This must be how Micah makes his songs – he simply nets them as if they were butterflies.\n\nI walk into the lake, sinking into a sandbar: it’s smooth and cool against my feet. I’m up to my waist in the Secret Beach’s dark waters. I stare back at myself through the ripples that radiate around me. Each song is a tree ring. Like a record player, I curl my finger into a stylus and lower it carefully into the wavy grooves below. “Miss You” plays, “God is” plays. I’m reminded of the smell of balsam poplar buds, and the way they stick to your toes. It’s a memory that the music has freed, and it carries me to shore. As far as I can tell, there’s no one around, and so I sing along, kicking at the water with an intoxicated abandon. \n\nThis is the secret of the Secret Beach: you get to make your own meaning, your own purpose. Through songs that blend the personal and universal, the Secret Beach encourages that meaning-making – and in doing so, makes some spectacularly great music.\n\nBut don’t tell anyone I told you that. That’s between you and me. \n\n- [The Famous Sandhogs](https://thefamoussandhogs.bandcamp.com/)",

In 2021, she became the first singer to win the coveted title of Musician of the Year at the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards. Iona is a fierce advocate for the official recognition of the Scots Language, leading a successful campaign to pressure Spotify into recognising Scots and add it to its list of languages. Honoured at the Scots Language Awards with the title of Speaker of the Year in 2021, Iona performs both folk and pop songs in the Scots language, remaining true to her rooting in tradition. Iona has featured in several publications including The Sunday Post, The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Times. She won the title of Scots Singer of the Year at the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards in 2018 and was described as “one of the best Scotland has to offer.” ~ Global-Music.de\n\n#Social Media# Facebook: [@ionafyfe](https://www.facebook.com/ionafyfe)\nTwitter: [@ionafyfe](https://twitter.com/ionafyfe)\nInstagram: [@iona.fyfe](https://www.instagram.com/iona.fyfe/)\nYouTube: [/ionafyfe](https://www.youtube.com/ionafyfe)\nSpotify: [/36PlU2e](https://spoti.fi/36PlU2e)\nBandcamp: [ionafyfe](https://ionafyfe.bandcamp.com/music)",

Spearheaded by longtime *Brian Jonestown Massacre* bassist *Collin Hegna*, the band was conceived as an outlet to channel inspiration from ‘60s & ‘70s European soundtracks, particularly those from Italy made famous by the Spaghetti Western & Giallo genres. As well as the narrative driven song stylings of Lee Hazlewood and Nick Cave.\n\n*Reverb & Seduction* is the legendary Portland band’s most immersive and varied album to date. A tour de force road trip from psych rock to country duets that never strays too far from the spaghetti western roots that inspired the band so many blood moons ago.\n\n“…equal parts Ennio Morricone, Lee Hazelwood, and Nick Cave with a touch of Chris Isaak’s less romantic side… few if any artists are brave and/or creative enough to channel this ghostly, often ominous vibe into moving, sensual and stirring music.”\n~ HAL HOROWITZ, American Songwriter",

      "details": "#Scott Pemberton# [Scott Pemberton’s](https://www.scottpemberton.com/) sound is much like the vibe of his native Portland:  freaky, fun and just the right amount of weird. The best way to categorize his music is with the moniker “Timber Rock”. Scott naturally applies his own lens/stamp to the sounds of the Pacific North West, the region he has always called home. The deep jazz, NW rock/grunge, blues roots and the west coast funk. It’s all there, and often all in the same song. Listeners are finding this honest, original and to-the-point music refreshing and fun.\n\nThe response to Scott’s music has made him an emerging force on the festival circuit, placed him at &num;1 in Portland’s pop charts, &num;4 on Bilboards “Tastmakers” chart and has generated notice from the press:\n“The Bruce Lee of Rock and Roll” –Tahoe Onstage\n“A modern day Jimi Hendrix” –Chico Enterprise\n“It’s not every day we get to see a real, live guitar god in action.” -Fly Magazine (Pennsylvania)\n“A wildly creative virtuoso.” -Jambase.com\n“Stand out artist at this year’s High Sierra Music Festival” –Relix Magazine.\n“At a festival FULL of guitarists (Safeway Water Front Blues Festival), none played like Pemberton or was as fun to watch” -The Oregonian\n\nThe mastery of his guitar playing combined with the fun recklessness of his songwriting show that the rules of songwriting and playing the guitar no longer exist for him. Scott plays with the uninhibited joy and intensity of someone who recognizes that every time we make music is an honor and a gift.",

Bichan’s fiddle is a melodic foil to Setiawan’s counterpoint and harmonic depth, and the two weave in and out seamlessly.\n\n*Setiawan* has won such accolades as the 2014 National Mandolin Championship, the 2017 RockyGrass Mandolin Championship and has shared the stage with the likes of Julian Lage, Darrell Scott, Bryan Sutton, Mike Marshall, Tony Trischka, Darol Anger, Casey Driessen, the Steel Wheels, Don Stiernberg, Matt Flinner, and Jacob Jolliff.\n\n*Bichan* has won awards for her compositions and playing, and has travelled far and wide to perform in various line ups since a young age. She has appeared at the likes of the BBC TV's Hogmanay Live show, Edinburgh Castle, Reading Festival, Cambridge Folk Festival, Lorient Interceltique Festival, Milwaukee Irish Festival and Sligo Live festival. In 2016 she released her first solo album, Out of My Own Light, to great acclaim.",

      "description": "Come see ukelele child prodigy Feng E from Taiwan on his first US tour.",
      "details": "#Feng E# [Feng E](https://www.instagram.com/fengeofficial/) is a young musical sensation (born in 2007) from Taiwan. His notoriety continues to skyrocket through his various ukulele covers of popular music with over 600K YouTube subscribers and millions of views. His expert renditions and his straight-forward “can do” attitude has turned the heads and stolen the hearts of some of the biggest stars in the world.\n\n#How It All Began# The reason Feng E took up the instrument in the first place was because his kindergarten teacher had discovered that his finger development was slow; he couldn’t draw a straight line or form a ball out of clay. His father tried to get him to play the piano, but the youngster lacked both interest and aptitude. When his father introduced him to the ukulele, he also resisted. But his father eventually found a way to convince him to practice: he offered to play Legos with him after each lesson, and it worked.\n\n#Accomplishments# To date, Feng E has mastered five musical instruments, starting with the piano at the age of four. He also has numerous compositions to his name. Although he has struggled to keep up in music class at school, Feng E has become a star in the world of ukulele music, performing and winning competitions around the world, in places like Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, China, and Hawaii. On “Asia’s Got Talent” (2017), he was the only competitor to get the Golden Buzzer from producer David Foster. In 2018, a video of Feng E playing Tommy Emmanuel’s arrangement of “Classical Gas,” with a ukulele in the park area of Taipei has nearly 20 million views. Owing to the viral video, Feng E was invited to “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” to play for a worldwide audience. He has since been on Ellen's show twice (2018 and 2019).",

      "details": "#Rakish# Violinist Maura Shawn Scanlin and guitarist Conor Hearn unite to form “[Rakish](https://www.rakishmusic.com/).” The pair gets their namesake from the traditional Irish tune Rakish Paddy, an origin that aptly suits the duo and their shared background in traditional Irish and Scottish music. Yet “rakish” itself also suggests something strikingly unconventional in its appearance, and Maura and Conor knowingly embrace this wealth of connotation in their music, drawing on the music they grew up with and performing it with their own slant. In a performance that toes the line between concert music and session music, Rakish explores tunes and songs from Irish and American folk traditions in a way that reflects their shared interest in and love for old traditional tunes and chamber music. Maura Shawn, a two-time U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Champion and a winner of the Glenfiddich Fiddle Competition, wields the technical range of a classical violinist and the deep sensitivity of a traditional musician. Conor, a native to the Irish music communities of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD, makes his home in Boston, MA playing and teaching guitar. As a duo they have performed at venues and festivals across North America, and can be found teaching at fiddle camps across the country.\n\n“Naturally nimble and stylistically well-matched, with a genuinely infectious sense of delight, heart, and jubilation.”\n~ David Templeton - Strings Magazine",

      "description": "Alice Di Micele with guitarist Andy Casad. “Alice’s music has that great combination of earthiness and groove that keeps it funky from the inside out. She’s for real.” ~ Bonnie Raitt",
      "details": "[Alice Di Micele](https://www.alicedimicele.com/) is an Americana/ Folk Singer-Songwriter based in Southern Oregon. Her voice is rangy, sometimes soft and intimate, other times bold and brassy, evoking a distinct mood in every song she sings. Alice built a dedicated fan base as an independent musician with stirring live performances spanning a three-decade career. Her new album, Every Seed We Plant, is her sixteenth release, a snapshot of life in these times – gut-wrenching, hopeful, vulnerable, intense.\n\nAlice collaborated with producer Bret Levick, who co-produced, arranged, and co-wrote the first track on her new release, leading Alice’s music into new territory. Pop, jazz, and rock and roll undercurrents flow beneath folk bedrock on this record. Her long-time bassists, Rob Kohler and Damian Erskine, joined talented players Bret Levick, Gene Black, Skip Edwards, David Jacobs- Strain, Jenny Conlee-Drizos, Andy Thorn, Terence Higgins, Barry Phillips, Dean Angermeier, Bob Evoniuk, Mikey Stevens, Matthew Kriemelman, and Christo Pellani on this album. Alice recorded her vocals and guitar tracks at her Tiny Wonderland studio in Southern Oregon.\n\nThe title track, Every Seed We Plant, was inspired by Alice’s dear friend and elder of the Takelma Tribe, Agnes Pilgrim Baker. “It was written on the way to Grandma Aggie’s memorial. The song overtook me, flowed out of me like Grandma was there guiding me. I wrote it, played it once, then sang it that day for her family and friends.”\n\nThe singles, Long Dry Winter and Alone, explore the grief, loss, and depression that many people experience these days. “I hope the songs remind folks to reach out and just simply be a presence for someone.” The new album balances the deeper emotional waters it treads with uplifting, lighter love songs like Free, and the fun, sparkly track, Sunrise.\n\nIn 2017, while mixing her One With The Tide album, she bonded with Bret Levick over rock and roll idol Tom Petty, whose untimely death that year inspired Bret and Alice to start the band Petty Thievery. This deep dive into Petty songs influenced Alice’s songwriting, “Getting inside another songwriter’s head by playing so many of his songs has really opened me up in a new way.”\n\nAs an accomplished songwriter, Alice draws on folk, jazz, blues, R & B, and rock & roll influences, landing her music consistently on AAA, Folk, Americana, and Community radio stations around the country and internationally, including syndicated shows. Her deep acoustic groove, unique vocal style, and heartfelt lyrics create an unmistakable sound that is all her own.\n\nShe is a delightful performer and has shared stages with Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, JJ Cale, David Grisman Quartet, Steve Winwood, Ferron, Peter Rowan, Richie Havens, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and so many others. Alice has also performed at many festivals, including Strawberry Music Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Oregon Country Fair, Joshua Tree Music Festivals, Britt Festivals, and Kate Wolf Music Festival.\n\nOriginally from New Jersey, Alice grew up singing in school choirs, “I sang on the way to school, and back home. I just made stuff up.” On her eleventh birthday, Alice’s Grandmother gave her Stevie Wonder’s album, Songs In The Key Of Life, “I learned every word, every note, and every nuance of that album by listening to it over and over.” She picked up the guitar at age 17 and honed her skills playing in coffeehouses in upstate New York and New Jersey. In 1986, she found her home in Southern Oregon and released her first recording in 1988,Make A Change.\n\nSixteen albums later, Alice is focused and clear on her mission, “I love solid, moving rhythm, and I do a lot of improvising vocally. I feel completely at home on stage. My job as a musician is to communicate emotion and stir that place inside that feels connected to other souls.”",

      "details": "#Sam Shackleton# ![Sam Shackleton](sam-shackleton-m.jpg) [Sam Shackleton](https://www.samshackleton.com/), also known by his Gaelic moniker, Sorley the Bard, is a Scottish singer-songwriter and folk artist. His music is greatly inspired by the rich inter-connected musical oral traditions of Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. Strongly influenced by the 1960's folk revival, his unique sound is a mix of country, old time, traditional, folk, and blues with a Scottish spirit. He was born in Stirling and raised all over Scotland, from the Borders to the Highlands and his music is deeply inspired by the oral tradition, musical culture, and landscapes of Scotland. \n\nAfter building up a large local following busking, then performing sold out shows in his hometown of Edinburgh, Sam burst onto the US folk scene in 2020 after gaining hundreds of thousands of views on the popular Nashville-based country and folk music channel, GemsOnVHS. He has since released his debut album, “Causeway Recordings” – awarded Top of the World by Songlines Magazine - and his subsequent EP, “Scottish Folk Ballads of Freedom,” to much critical acclaim. In recent months, Sam’s videos busking around Scotland have gone viral on TikTok and Instagram and he has gathered a large and loyal fanbase of followers and listeners on Spotify and YouTube.\n\n#Nick Hans# ![Nick Hans](nick-hans-m.jpg) [Nick Hans](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ZJVsU3d169tIJFuZT3fMm) writes songs drawing primarily from his own life – sometimes dark, sometimes beautiful. He left Tennessee in his late teens and began crisscrossing the country by freight train, working seasonal jobs, farming, and living in punk and radical communities. When he found a cassette tape with Leadbelly on one side and Woody Guthrie on the other, he was blown away by the beauty and power of those legendary musicians and their songs. He picked up a beat-up Stella guitar, and has been writing and playing his own songs ever since. Hans spent many years living in New Orleans, playing shows and busking with an ever-changing cast of musicians, including his previous bands the Sluetown Strutters and the Stay All Night Rounders. He currently lives in Taos, New Mexico, where he continues to farm, work, and write music.",

We're [The Wildwoods](https://www.thewildwoodsband.com/), where each lyric is a leaf in the vast forest of our sound.”\n\nIn the heart of Lincoln, Nebraska, The Wildwoods emerge as a folk/Americana trio, a musical tapestry woven by the husband-and-wife duo, Noah (guitar) and Chloe Gose (violin), accompanied by the bassist Andrew Vaggalis. Their story is a symphony of exploration and connection, a journey that has taken them from the Midwest to international stages, carving out a unique place in the folk landscape.  Their presence has graced stages alongside artists such as Mighty Poplar, Sierra Ferrell, Aiofe O’ Donovan, Melissa Carper, Jamie Wyatt and Joe Nichols at concerts and festivals like Summerfest, FreshGrass and the Oyster Ridge Music Festival.\n\nThe Wildwoods have become a force in the folk scene, boasting accolades like being finalists at the FreshGrass Music Festival Band competition and Gems on VHS “Gems in the Rough” competition in 2023. Their songwriting prowess is underscored by semi-final placements in the International Songwriting competition, with tracks like “Untitled” and “Way of Train.” Recognized consistently at the Omaha Arts and Entertainment Awards, they were crowned “Best Band” by the Lincoln Journal Star’s Lincoln Choice Awards in 2022.\n\nTheir sonic journey unfolds through albums like the debut “Sweet Nostalgia” (2017), followed by “Birdie & Goose” (2017), “Across A Midwest Sky” (2019), and their latest masterpiece, “Foxfield Saint John” (2023). The band's evolution is evident in each track, a testament to their commitment to pushing musical boundaries.\n\nUnited by a passion for folk/Americana, the trio’s influences range from Watchhouse and  Nickel Creek,  to Gillian Welch & David Rawlings. Their music, though comfortably under the folk/Americana umbrella, weaves intricate chord structures and emotional textures that defy genre boundaries. Together, their harmonies resonate with artful sincerity, drawing inspiration from nature, their shared experiences of growing up in Nebraska, and life on the road.  ",

Guitarists from Leo Kottke to Larry Corryel, to Tuck Andress, Tommy Emmanuel, Mark Knopfler, Andrew York, Andy Timmons, to Steve Lukather… have sung his praises, and Steve Vai released three Bensusan albums on his label Favored Nations. And it's not just guitarists who are so inspired by Pierre's music, as a recent studio collaboration with him on Donny Osmond’s latest album “Start Again” goes to show.\n\nIf World Music means the fusion of traditional, contemporary, jazz, classical and pop music, then Bensusan is one of the most eloquent World Music musicians of our time. A pianist in his beginnings then self-taught on the guitar, the originality of his style makes him one of today’s greatest guitarists and composers for the instrument. Also called “The Prince of DADGAD”, his story is far from trivial and it is on stage that this artist has earned his stripes: among others, the Rose d'Or of the Montreux Festival, and being elected Best Guitarist of World Music by the readers of Guitar Player Magazine! His triple album “Encore” won the Grand Prix of the Independent Music Awards in the category Best Live Album... Since his first performances in 1974 in France, the guitarist has sold half a million albums and given thousands of concerts around the globe, both solo and through numerous collaborations.\n\nBorn in French Algeria, Pierre Bensusan is an adventurer of unusual lands. His almost “sacred” music is an intimate and orchestral hymn, a solo crossing on a multi-shell Lowden guitar subjected to the natural elements with sound molecules and finger pulp on an ebony fingerboard for open tuning - an unique and transparent technique, under the fingers of an adventurous pilgrim. Big emotion guaranteed.",

It is our experience that when poetry – learned by heart and embodied – is spoken, it carries something of Soul with it and is, at once, more apprehensible and more meaningful to the listener than poetry read from a page.\n\nThe original intention was three-fold:\n-To support local community benefit organizations\n-To build community\n-To help restore the oral tradition of poetry, to inspire audiences with a new imagination of the possible.\n\nEver since, the Caravan has delighted audiences at our annual signature event in Sonoma County combining music, poetry and festivity. Often, Sima Vaghti has generously provided a Persian feast.  Critics have called us “the premier poetry event of the year for the North Bay.”\n\nThe Caravan is both an event and a performance company. In addition to the annual event in Sonoma County, the Caravan has performed in Oakland, Gualala, Chico, Sonoma, and Redding/Mt. Shasta. All proceeds from our performances go to support local community organizations such as the Center for Climate Protection, the Siskiyou County Public Library, the Gualala Arts Council, the Ceres Community Project, Youth Speaks. the Middle East Children’s Alliance and others. \n\nPerhaps more importantly, Rumi’s Caravan has been part of a growing international renaissance of interest in poetry and story learned and shared by heart. In this small way we hope to contribute to the restoration of the wholeness of the world.\n\n“The task of a liberated person is not to scold the world and preach to it, but to delight it back to its senses.”\n~ Alan Watts ",

The movie examines the fundamental moments of Mother Teresa’s life from her childhood in Albania in the 1920s to her first calling as a nun, the decision to leave her order and live with the poorest of the poor, the vicissitudes of founding the Congregation of the Missionaries of Charity, and her great work of service in Calcutta and the rest of the world.\n\nA shrewd diplomat and an indomitable force, Mother Teresa was unwilling to accept what others deemed impossible, fearlessly fighting for the unloved and the forgotten. She was regarded as one of the most significant personalities of the 20th Century, although she never owned more than a white and blue sari. She influenced the decisions of the most powerful men on Earth, although she always stayed close to the poorest people of the world.\n\nThe film follows her through the slums of Calcutta as she mingled closely with her people, dispensing help, joy and smiles to everyone, with her loving embraces, and also shows her stubbornness with the people who wanted to block her way.\n\nHer faith and good works transcended hardships and ultimately earned her international acclaim, including the Nobel Peace prize. The many small miracles, great charity and humble triumphs of Mother Teresa will inspire you in this poignant tale of a modern-day saint.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

The two leads are played by very appealing performers, Mary Petruolo and Ettore Bassi, who give genuinely inspiring and beautifully moving performances of the daughter of a patrician family and the son of a rich merchant who leave all to follow Christ. Francis renounces his inheritance of wealth to live the Gospel and serve the poor and outcasts. Clare reads deep into his heart and decides to follow him, leaving her home and family to give herself as the bride of Christ. Both found major religious orders and together they inspire many to follow their radical call to live the Gospel, and their impact has even reached across the centuries to change the world.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

How he did this, I can’t tell you. But it came to him as if by revelation: if place is being, then you must become that place: become the Secret Beach: become a firmament for sunny summer days: become a place where you feel like you belong, a place that reminds you of home, a place that is home. And so he became the beach. This is what the Songs from Secret Beach do, too – they can shatter and scatter you into the winds, they can peer into you as if you were glass, they can weather the edges of your broken bottles. And they allow for others – like me – to reflect. You can hear them easier out here. Listen. Put your ears to the ground. Do you hear it? Each grain of sand sings a secret song. Each one is no less important than another. I hear billions around me. A chorus of melodies swarm along the shoreline. This must be how Micah makes his songs – he simply nets them as if they were butterflies.\n\nI walk into the lake, sinking into a sandbar: it’s smooth and cool against my feet. I’m up to my waist in the Secret Beach’s dark waters. I stare back at myself through the ripples that radiate around me. Each song is a tree ring. Like a record player, I curl my finger into a stylus and lower it carefully into the wavy grooves below. “Miss You” plays, “God is” plays. I’m reminded of the smell of balsam poplar buds, and the way they stick to your toes. It’s a memory that the music has freed, and it carries me to shore. As far as I can tell, there’s no one around, and so I sing along, kicking at the water with an intoxicated abandon. \n\nThis is the secret of the Secret Beach: you get to make your own meaning, your own purpose. Through songs that blend the personal and universal, the Secret Beach encourages that meaning-making – and in doing so, makes some spectacularly great music.\n\nBut don’t tell anyone I told you that. That’s between you and me. \n\n- [The Famous Sandhogs](https://thefamoussandhogs.bandcamp.com/)",

      "details": "#The Clements Brothers# [The Clements Brothers](https://www.theclementsbrothers.com/) are George and Charles Clements, identical twins from New England. They’ve been playing and writing music together for as long as they can remember and ‘The Clements Brothers’ marks their first project together since playing in the internationally touring grass-roots band, ‘The Lonely Heartstring Band’ with whom they put out two albums on Rounder Records. With roots, rock, bluegrass, jazz, and classical influences, George (on guitar) and Charles (on bass) aim to capture their singer-songwriter sensibilities in a unique blended voice, at once enthralling and intimate, groovy and serene. They are joined by drummer Mike Harmon, who joined the band after an impromptu late night set at the Ossipee Music festival, and adds his unique roots-conscious musicality to the group's evolving sound.  The trio is a fusion of each member's unique musical journey, and the result is music all its own, filled with vocal harmonies, instrumental virtuosity, and a genuine love of song.",
