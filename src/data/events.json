      "details": "#Sam Shackleton# ![Sam Shackleton](sam-shackleton-m.jpg) [Sam Shackleton](https://www.samshackleton.com/), also known by his Gaelic moniker, Sorley the Bard, is a Scottish singer-songwriter and folk artist. His music is greatly inspired by the rich inter-connected musical oral traditions of Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. Strongly influenced by the 1960's folk revival, his unique sound is a mix of country, old time, traditional, folk, and blues with a Scottish spirit. He was born in Stirling and raised all over Scotland, from the Borders to the Highlands and his music is deeply inspired by the oral tradition, musical culture, and landscapes of Scotland. \n\nAfter building up a large local following busking, then performing sold out shows in his hometown of Edinburgh, Sam burst onto the US folk scene in 2020 after gaining hundreds of thousands of views on the popular Nashville-based country and folk music channel, GemsOnVHS. He has since released his debut album, “Causeway Recordings” – awarded Top of the World by Songlines Magazine - and his subsequent EP, “Scottish Folk Ballads of Freedom,” to much critical acclaim. In recent months, Sam’s videos busking around Scotland have gone viral on TikTok and Instagram and he has gathered a large and loyal fanbase of followers and listeners on Spotify and YouTube.\n\n#Nick Hans# ![Nick Hans](nick-hans-m.jpg) [Nick Hans](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ZJVsU3d169tIJFuZT3fMm) writes songs drawing primarily from his own life – sometimes dark, sometimes beautiful. He left Tennessee in his late teens and began crisscrossing the country by freight train, working seasonal jobs, farming, and living in punk and radical communities. When he found a cassette tape with Leadbelly on one side and Woody Guthrie on the other, he was blown away by the beauty and power of those legendary musicians and their songs. He picked up a beat-up Stella guitar, and has been writing and playing his own songs ever since. Hans spent many years living in New Orleans, playing shows and busking with an ever-changing cast of musicians, including his previous bands the Sluetown Strutters and the Stay All Night Rounders. He currently lives in Taos, New Mexico, where he continues to farm, work, and write music.",

We're [The Wildwoods](https://www.thewildwoodsband.com/), where each lyric is a leaf in the vast forest of our sound.”\n\nIn the heart of Lincoln, Nebraska, The Wildwoods emerge as a folk/Americana trio, a musical tapestry woven by the husband-and-wife duo, Noah (guitar) and Chloe Gose (violin), accompanied by the bassist Andrew Vaggalis. Their story is a symphony of exploration and connection, a journey that has taken them from the Midwest to international stages, carving out a unique place in the folk landscape.  Their presence has graced stages alongside artists such as Mighty Poplar, Sierra Ferrell, Aiofe O’ Donovan, Melissa Carper, Jamie Wyatt and Joe Nichols at concerts and festivals like Summerfest, FreshGrass and the Oyster Ridge Music Festival.\n\nThe Wildwoods have become a force in the folk scene, boasting accolades like being finalists at the FreshGrass Music Festival Band competition and Gems on VHS “Gems in the Rough” competition in 2023. Their songwriting prowess is underscored by semi-final placements in the International Songwriting competition, with tracks like “Untitled” and “Way of Train.” Recognized consistently at the Omaha Arts and Entertainment Awards, they were crowned “Best Band” by the Lincoln Journal Star’s Lincoln Choice Awards in 2022.\n\nTheir sonic journey unfolds through albums like the debut “Sweet Nostalgia” (2017), followed by “Birdie & Goose” (2017), “Across A Midwest Sky” (2019), and their latest masterpiece, “Foxfield Saint John” (2023). The band's evolution is evident in each track, a testament to their commitment to pushing musical boundaries.\n\nUnited by a passion for folk/Americana, the trio’s influences range from Watchhouse and  Nickel Creek,  to Gillian Welch & David Rawlings. Their music, though comfortably under the folk/Americana umbrella, weaves intricate chord structures and emotional textures that defy genre boundaries. Together, their harmonies resonate with artful sincerity, drawing inspiration from nature, their shared experiences of growing up in Nebraska, and life on the road.  ",

      "details": "#Pierre Bensusan# “It’s Like The Guitar Has Been Given Free Reign To Play It’s Self!”\n\nFrench-Algerian acoustic guitar virtuoso, vocalist and composer [Pierre Bensusan](https://www.pierrebensusan.com/), surnamed “Mister DADGAD”, has taken his unique sound to all corners of the globe.\n\nWinner of the Independent Music Award for his triple live album “Encore”, voted Best World Music Guitarist by Guitar Player Magazine reader’s Poll, winner of the Rose d’Or at the Montreux Festival for his debut album, Pierre is recognized as one of the greatest guitar players of the 21st century.\n\nWhen Michael Hedges titles one of his compositions “Bensusan”, you know that the inspiration behind it must be special and Pierre Bensusan certainly is. Guitarists from Leo Kottke to Larry Corryel, to Tuck Andress, Tommy Emmanuel, Mark Knopfler, Andrew York, Andy Timmons, to Steve Lukather… have sung his praises, and Steve Vai released three Bensusan albums on his label Favored Nations. And it's not just guitarists who are so inspired by Pierre's music, as a recent studio collaboration with him on Donny Osmond’s latest album “Start Again” goes to show.\n\nIf World Music means the fusion of traditional, contemporary, jazz, classical and pop music, then Bensusan is one of the most eloquent World Music musicians of our time. A pianist in his beginnings then self-taught on the guitar, the originality of his style makes him one of today’s greatest guitarists and composers for the instrument. Also called “The Prince of DADGAD”, his story is far from trivial and it is on stage that this artist has earned his stripes: among others, the Rose d'Or of the Montreux Festival, and being elected Best Guitarist of World Music by the readers of Guitar Player Magazine! His triple album “Encore” won the Grand Prix of the Independent Music Awards in the category Best Live Album... Since his first performances in 1974 in France, the guitarist has sold half a million albums and given thousands of concerts around the globe, both solo and through numerous collaborations.\n\nBorn in French Algeria, Pierre Bensusan is an adventurer of unusual lands. His almost “sacred” music is an intimate and orchestral hymn, a solo crossing on a multi-shell Lowden guitar subjected to the natural elements with sound molecules and finger pulp on an ebony fingerboard for open tuning - an unique and transparent technique, under the fingers of an adventurous pilgrim. Big emotion guaranteed.",

It is our experience that when poetry – learned by heart and embodied – is spoken, it carries something of Soul with it and is, at once, more apprehensible and more meaningful to the listener than poetry read from a page.\n\nThe original intention was three-fold:\n-To support local community benefit organizations\n-To build community\n-To help restore the oral tradition of poetry, to inspire audiences with a new imagination of the possible.\n\nEver since, the Caravan has delighted audiences at our annual signature event in Sonoma County combining music, poetry and festivity. Often, Sima Vaghti has generously provided a Persian feast.  Critics have called us “the premier poetry event of the year for the North Bay.”\n\nThe Caravan is both an event and a performance company. In addition to the annual event in Sonoma County, the Caravan has performed in Oakland, Gualala, Chico, Sonoma, and Redding/Mt. Shasta. All proceeds from our performances go to support local community organizations such as the Center for Climate Protection, the Siskiyou County Public Library, the Gualala Arts Council, the Ceres Community Project, Youth Speaks. the Middle East Children’s Alliance and others. \n\nPerhaps more importantly, Rumi’s Caravan has been part of a growing international renaissance of interest in poetry and story learned and shared by heart. In this small way we hope to contribute to the restoration of the wholeness of the world.\n\n“The task of a liberated person is not to scold the world and preach to it, but to delight it back to its senses.”\n~ Alan Watts ",

      "details": "[Saint Philip Neri](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1680043/): An epic feature film on the famous “Apostle of Rome” and great friend of youth in the 16th century. One of the most popular saints of all time, St. Philip Neri was widely known for his great charity, deep prayer life, and tremendous humor. Hoping to join St. Ignatius of Loyola’s new order of Jesuits and be a missionary to India, Philip was instead guided by Providence to seek out the poor and abandoned youth of Rome to catechize them in the faith and help them find a better life. He became the founder of the religious congregation, the Oratory, that worked with the youth and also labored to re-evangelize a decadent Rome.\n\nThis captivating film highlights Neri’s great love for youth, his warm sense of humor, contagious joy, deep mystical spirituality, and his amazing gift for miracles. Actor Gigi Proietti gives a moving performance as St. Philip in this beautifully produced film.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

Made in Italy with top-notch acting talent, and superb cinematography, this is an outstanding film on the amazing life of St. Anthony. It presents Anthony as a dynamic and appealing person who sacrificed wealth, popularity and family for the Kingdom of God.\n\nBorn into a Portugese noble family in 1195, Anthony defied his father’s wishes to become a knight and, instead, followed the call of God to become a monk, eventually joining the Franciscans as a follower of St. Francis of Assisi. Anthony became renowned for his powerful preaching and his miracles that won countless souls to Christ. The film follows his travels through Italy, his mission to Morocco and his meeting with St. Francis. It beautifully portrays the power of his preaching, the holiness of his life, his love for the poor and oppressed, and the wonders of his miracles.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

The movie examines the fundamental moments of Mother Teresa’s life from her childhood in Albania in the 1920s to her first calling as a nun, the decision to leave her order and live with the poorest of the poor, the vicissitudes of founding the Congregation of the Missionaries of Charity, and her great work of service in Calcutta and the rest of the world.\n\nA shrewd diplomat and an indomitable force, Mother Teresa was unwilling to accept what others deemed impossible, fearlessly fighting for the unloved and the forgotten. She was regarded as one of the most significant personalities of the 20th Century, although she never owned more than a white and blue sari. She influenced the decisions of the most powerful men on Earth, although she always stayed close to the poorest people of the world.\n\nThe film follows her through the slums of Calcutta as she mingled closely with her people, dispensing help, joy and smiles to everyone, with her loving embraces, and also shows her stubbornness with the people who wanted to block her way.\n\nHer faith and good works transcended hardships and ultimately earned her international acclaim, including the Nobel Peace prize. The many small miracles, great charity and humble triumphs of Mother Teresa will inspire you in this poignant tale of a modern-day saint.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

The two leads are played by very appealing performers, Mary Petruolo and Ettore Bassi, who give genuinely inspiring and beautifully moving performances of the daughter of a patrician family and the son of a rich merchant who leave all to follow Christ. Francis renounces his inheritance of wealth to live the Gospel and serve the poor and outcasts. Clare reads deep into his heart and decides to follow him, leaving her home and family to give herself as the bride of Christ. Both found major religious orders and together they inspire many to follow their radical call to live the Gospel, and their impact has even reached across the centuries to change the world.\n\nPresented in collaboration with [https://www.blueskiesunlimited.com](Blue Skies Unlimited)",

      "details": "[The Reluctant Saint](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056403/): Maximilian Schell stars as “the flying friar”, St. Joseph of Cupertino, in this heartwarming and amazing true story of the humble Franciscan friar who literally rose to sainthood in the impoverished village of 17th century Cupertino, Italy. Joseph’s peasant mother convinces the reluctant Abbott (Ricardo Montalban) to accept her son into the monastery and by a series of miraculous incidents, the simple but pious Joseph is ordained a priest. Yet some are convinced that it is the devil,not God, who is responsible for Joseph’s miraculous powers – until a final miracle reveals to all, his true sanctity.\n\n\nPERSONAL NOTE FROM SAHADEV (event producer)\n\nI’m setting up this event with a triple purpose:\n1) To inspire! ✨\n2) As a fundraiser for JCA!

      "description": "The Secret Beach is the moniker used by Canadian artist Micah Erenberg, whose refreshingly plainspoken candor has become a dominant through-line in the singer/songwriters ever-expanding catalog. With special guest Matt Jolliff.",
      "details": "#The Secret Beach# Everyone loves a secret: a shortcut through the woods, a fishing hole, a beach.\n\n![Micah Erenberg](micah-erenberg-m.jpg)I’m at [the Secret Beach](https://www.thesecretbeach.ca/) now, and I’m reminded that it’s been years since Micah Erenberg merged into the rocks and trees and sand that line this endless spine of a beach – a beach that arches out of an inland ocean like a giant waking from a marshy sleep. How he did this, I can’t tell you. But it came to him as if by revelation: if place is being, then you must become that place: become the Secret Beach: become a firmament for sunny summer days: become a place where you feel like you belong, a place that reminds you of home, a place that is home. And so he became the beach. This is what the Songs from Secret Beach do, too – they can shatter and scatter you into the winds, they can peer into you as if you were glass, they can weather the edges of your broken bottles. And they allow for others – like me – to reflect. You can hear them easier out here. Listen. Put your ears to the ground. Do you hear it? Each grain of sand sings a secret song. Each one is no less important than another. I hear billions around me. A chorus of melodies swarm along the shoreline. This must be how Micah makes his songs – he simply nets them as if they were butterflies.\n\nI walk into the lake, sinking into a sandbar: it’s smooth and cool against my feet. I’m up to my waist in the Secret Beach’s dark waters. I stare back at myself through the ripples that radiate around me. Each song is a tree ring. Like a record player, I curl my finger into a stylus and lower it carefully into the wavy grooves below. “Miss You” plays, “God is” plays. I’m reminded of the smell of balsam poplar buds, and the way they stick to your toes. It’s a memory that the music has freed, and it carries me to shore. As far as I can tell, there’s no one around, and so I sing along, kicking at the water with an intoxicated abandon. \n\nThis is the secret of the Secret Beach: you get to make your own meaning, your own purpose. Through songs that blend the personal and universal, the Secret Beach encourages that meaning-making – and in doing so, makes some spectacularly great music.\n\nBut don’t tell anyone I told you that. That’s between you and me. \n\n- [The Famous Sandhogs](https://thefamoussandhogs.bandcamp.com/)",

With roots, rock, bluegrass, jazz, and classical influences, George (on guitar) and Charles (on bass) aim to capture their singer-songwriter sensibilities in a unique blended voice, at once enthralling and intimate, groovy and serene. They are joined by drummer Mike Harmon, who joined the band after an impromptu late night set at the Ossipee Music festival, and adds his unique roots-conscious musicality to the group's evolving sound.  The trio is a fusion of each member's unique musical journey, and the result is music all its own, filled with vocal harmonies, instrumental virtuosity, and a genuine love of song.",
