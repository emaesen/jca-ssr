This 2,500-year-old practice named Dana involves receiving teachings from the monks, and then giving the monks support in the form of offerings of food, shelter, and funds. *Our ability to offer these teachings and support Tibetan culture depends on the generosity of each of us.*\n\nWhile Theatrical performances and Art exhibits (Sand Mandalas) may have admission prices, in Mount Shasta they are often funded by grants from local foundations and generous individuals making them free to the public.\n*We deeply thank those who make this possible.*\n\n\n![MSFoTC GSCF banner](msfotc-gscf-banner.jpg)^ #Purpose of the Tour#\nThe purpose of the tour is to share with all people the monks’ culture, as well as practices and paths to inner peace and compassion. Accomplishments of previous tours have provided funds for construction of new buildings at Gaden Shartse, including the new debate hall. Additional funds raised by past tours have supported medical needs, teachers’ salaries and the day to day expenses of supporting the monastery. This success is due to the help and generosity of those who support the tours. The monks of Gaden Shartse feel deeply indebted to their friends in the West who have given their time, effort, and homes to make the tours possible. It is hoped that the upcoming tour will be a success. The Gaden Shartse Cultural Foundation is grateful for donations which may come from any source: private entities, businesses, institutions, or government grants. All donations must be paid to the order of Gaden Shartse Cultural Foundation which is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization.\n\nThe success of this Tour depends on you.\n\n*Questions? Want to help?

      "details": " ![event poster](shasta-taiko-goh-kurosawa-poster.jpg) [Shasta Taiko](https://www.facebook.com/ShastaTaiko/)\n\nShasta Taiko was founded by American taiko (Japanese drum) pioneers Jeanne Mercer and Russel Baba in 1985. Shasta Taiko has taught hundreds of Siskiyou County children and adults, exposed taiko to thousands through various performances, and presented leading American taiko artists at ShastaYama (2005-2016), the largest outdoor taiko festival in the country.\n\nShasta Taiko’s performances present original taiko compositions, some based in Japanese traditions and others from American, world, and modern influences.\n\n“Shasta Taiko...pushed the bounds of traditional music, bringing a new creativity that will carry taiko into the next generation...fashioning a new cultural and artistic tradition.” - Anchorage Daily News\n\n“...original arrangements of traditional taiko rhythms...individual solos of impressive complexity and imagination amid a clean, well crafted ensemble texture.” - San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“...what started as a casual band of family and friends in 1985 has mushroomed into Shasta Taiko...spreading a thunderous message of festivity and harmony.” - Los Angeles Times\n\n“Their (Shasta Taiko) performance was a powerful, yet very gentle, call for peace and understanding.” - Nikkei West\n\nShasta Taiko has received national attention with “Shasta Taiko,” a documentary that won a Cable “ACE” award, and featured in documentaries, “The Spirit of Taiko” and “Big Drum.”\n\nMercer and Baba started taiko in 1972 with San Francisco Taiko Dojo and Grand Master Seiichi Tanaka. As a member of Taiko Dojo, Jeanne toured worldwide and contributed to movie soundtracks “Star Wars” and “Apocalypse Now.” Russel has recorded, performed, and toured on saxophone and flutes playing original music with jazz artists pianist Andrew Hill, violinist Michael White, and drummer Eddie Moore. Russel and Jeanne continue to influence and inspire a new taiko generation and the wider taiko community\n\n\n[Goh Kurosawa](http://www.composelife.com/)\n\nScott Yanow (journalist for AllMusic & LA Jazz Scene) expresses:\n\n“International touring musician Goh Kurosawa's music is beyond any simple classification. The guitarist improvises melodically, is open to the influences of pop, rock, flamenco, classical, Latin and Japanese music, and has his own musical identity. Equally skilled on electric and acoustic guitars, he uses electrical devices to create a wide range of sounds yet is not shy to embrace a pretty melody; Goh's set included Bob Marley's No Women No Cry, My Family My Friends (original), a Japanese folk song, and Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah (which he sang).”\n\nPlaying at the Homeboy Industries (the largest gang rehabilitation and re-entry program in the world) for Christmas Fest 2021, thus far Goh has completed concerts and music workshops in Myanmar, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Canada, France, US, and Japan. Kurosawa has performed at the Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival in Mexico four times, NHK and Saga Television in Japan, Spring Scream Rock Fest in Taiwan, Asian American Jazz Fest in Los Angeles, LA18 Television, as well as events affiliated with the embassies. On the cover of Pasadena Weekly, album reviewed by JazzTimes Magazine plus other publications, and during the pandemic Goh started Across Waters; an online event for music plus multi-cultural discussions with people from Japan, US, and beyond.",

      "details": " ![QWANQWA poster](qwanqwa-poster.jpg) [QWANQWA](https://www.qwanqwa.net/) IS A SUPERGROUP OF MUSICIANS FROM THE BADDEST ENSEMBLES OF ADDIS ABABA.\n\nBrought together by a shared passion for the power of Ethiopian music, this group shines an experimentalism based in the virtuosity of rooted traditions. With swirling masinko (one-stringed fiddle), wah-wah-violin, bass krar boom, and the unstoppable rhythm of heavy kebero (goat-skin drum) beats, powerful traditional lead African diva vocals, QWANQWA keeps the people wrapped in celebratory attention. After making a splash at world renowned festivals Roskilde and WOMEX, and after 3 European tours under their belt,  this world traveling ensemble is hitting the road for a MacArthur Foundation backed Debut US tour in 2022\n\nQWANQWA draws inspiration from East Africa regions of Ethiopia and beyond. Delving deep into regional beats and moods, the repertoire ranges from a trance-like song of the Eritrean tribe of Blen to a Somalian rock number to Mahmoud Ahmed sing-a-longs. The music is characterized by tight arrangements and extended experimental moments. The live show ranges from intimate to wild, from whispery conversations to full blown rock show, and it is hard to believe these psychedelic sounds are coming from traditional harp and violin. It is driving, powerful, and different than anything else coming out of Ethiopia at this current Golden Age of Ethiopian music.\n\nThe ensemble was founded in 2012 by American violinist Kaethe Hostetter, who first worked in Ethiopian music as a founding member of critically acclaimed Debo Band. Since relocating to Addis in 2009, she has participated in numerous exploratory and professional projects, as she honed her sound and immersed herself further into the culture of her surroundings. In this sense, QWANQWA, the Amharic word for “language,” is a project creating dialogues between cultures.\n\nCurrent members of QWANQWA are Endris Hassen (masinko), Kaethe Hostetter (violin), Bubu Teklemariam (bass krar), Selamnesh Zemene (vocalist), and Misale Legesse (kebero). They have appeared internationally with Getachew Mekuria, The EX, Thurston Moore, Fred Frith, Butch Morris, Debo Band, Nile Project, Fendika, Mahmoud Ahmed, Mulatu Astatke, Addis Acoustic, Ethiocolor, Atse Teodros, Mohammed “Jimmy” Mohammed, and Imperial Tiger Orchestra, and have played stages from Lincoln Center to Bonnaroo, Jazzfest (New Orleans), Moers Festival, Roskilde, WOMEX, WOMAD and more.\n\nAn integral and constant presence in Addis Ababa nightlife scene, QWANQWA has been featured performance at Roskilde 2016 (Northern Europe’s biggest music festival).\n\nTheir 2022 tour of US, a 48 date US tour backed by the MacArthur Foundation\n\nSince their founding in 2012, QWANQWA have released three albums: Volume One (2014) and Volume Two (2015), and Volume Three (2020).",

      "description": "The JCA World Music Festival presents an evening of Indian music: Arjun Verma on sitar with William Rossel on tabla.",
      "details": " ![event poster](arjun-verma-w-william-rossel-poster-2.jpg) [Arjun Verma](https://www.arjun-verma.com/), sitarist, was trained by the legendary Maestro Ali Akbar Khan\n\nWith over three decades of performance experience, at venues including the United Nations (Geneva), the Fillmore (San Francisco), Fox Theater (Oakland), Pattee Arena (Monterey), the New School (New York), Birmingham Museum of Art (Birmingham), Prague Castle (Prague), and NBC Bay Area television (San Jose), Arjun has emerged with a unique voice on the sitar—both within the tradition of North Indian Classical Music, and through his innovative cross-genre collaborations.\n\nArjun has spent his entire life steeped in the tradition of North Indian Classical Music.  The son of internationally performing sitarist Roop Verma, who was a disciple of Ali Akbar Khan and Ravi Shankar, Arjun began learning sitar from his father at age five.\n\nAs a teenager, Arjun was deeply inspired by the preeminent sarode maestro, Ali Akbar Khan, and he ultimately moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to study directly with Ali Akbar Khan for eight years.  Since the Maestro’s passing in 2009, Arjun has continued his training under the able guidance of Ali Akbar Khan’s son, Alam Khan.  Arjun has also received guidance from Smt. Annapurna Devi.\n\nAs a musician of the Maihar Gharana (style) of Hindustani classical music, Arjun’s playing is based on the music of Maestro Ali Akbar Khan.  He has developed innovative sitar techniques inspired by the Maestro’s style, and is also influenced by sitarist Nikhil Banerjee.  Arjun’s playing also incorporates musical elements drawn from his long apprenticeship with his father, Roop Verma.  The combination of these influences results in a style encompassing the deeply contemplative as well as the exhilarating elements of Indian Music.\n\nArjun began performing at the age of seven, and has played concerts in the United States, Europe, and India, including performances with Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri, Sri Alam Khan, Pandit Sharda Sahai, Ustad Shabbir Nisar, Bob Weir, Salar Nader, George Brooks, Nilan Chaudhuri, Indranil Mallick, Anirban Roy Chowdhury, and members of the Houston and St. Louis Symphonies.\n\nArjun has performed in front of dignitaries including former United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and spiritual leader Morari Bapu, and has been awarded a Mosaic Silicon Valley commissioning grant to compose for Philharmonia Baroque (2020—Sangam Arts), a Creative Work Fund grant (2018—Haas Foundation), and a Shenson Fellowship (2007—San Francisco Foundation) to support his work.\n\nCombining western classical music with Indian classical music, Arjun was the featured sitar soloist for the world premieres of Jack Perla’s River of Light (2014—Houston Grand Opera), Shalimar the Clown (2016—Opera Theatre St. Louis), and Arjun’s own Bach in Bengal (2022—Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra).\n\nAs a composer, Arjun has written commissioned works for documentary film, opera, and live performing arts, and has arranged numerous works of Indian classical music for ensembles of both Indian and non-Indian instrumentation. \n\nIn 2021, Arjun released a solo album, EPIPHANIES, exploring his very personal relationship with the sitar and Indian classical music. Recorded with cutting-edge studio technology, this album was released in HD and Ambisonic (surround) formats, raising the bar for the sound of the sitar.\n\nArjun has also recorded with GRAMMY-winning jazz arranger & pianist John Beasley, in addition to numerous recordings for Disney television.\n\nArjun’s music has received critical acclaim from leading publications, including the New York Times, Times of India, Sruti Magazine, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nIn addition to performing, Arjun teaches sitar and North Indian Classical Music at the Ali Akbar College of Music and the East-West School of Music.\n\n\n\n[William Rossel](http://williamrossel.com/), disciple of legendary tabla maestro Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri, is a talented tabla player, educator, composer, and inventor in the field of world music. Originally a student of Western classical vocal music, he began training in Hindustani music nearly two decades ago under sitarist Nalini Vinayak. Since 2006, he has been training under tabla maestro Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri at both the Ali Akbar College of Music and at the California Institute of the Arts where he earned a Master of Fine Arts in North Indian Classical Music, also studying Indian music theory from sarode master Ustad Aashish Khan.\n\nEqually strong on tabla as a soloist and accompanist, William has accompanied such prominent artists as Alam Khan, Arjun Verma, Suman Laha, Manik Khan, Bruce Hamm, Steve Oda, Rita Sahai, and many others. He has given numerous solo recitals and lecture demonstrations at the Ali Akbar College of Music, the Aashish Khan School of World Music, Fort Mason Center of Arts and Culture, the San Francisco Asian Art Museum, the Sangati Center, UC Berkeley, California Institute of the Arts, California College of the Arts, California Jazz Conservatory, California Polytechnic State University, Sonoma State University, Florida State University, Yuba College, Pasadena City College, and at private venues across the country.\n\nA professor of music at Yuba College, William is the director of the Yuba College North Indian Music Ensemble, which he created in 2016, and he teaches a wide range of classes, including Intro to World Music, Music as Culture, Western Music Appreciation, Popular Music of the U.S. and Applied Lessons in Percussion. William, is also a tabla instructor at the Ali Akbar College of Music and teaches rhythm theory (taal). He is also a Senior Lecturer at the California College of the Arts, in Oakland, and has directed North Indian music ensembles at the California Institute of the Arts’ Community Arts Partnership.\n\nWilliam's interests in world music have led him to study the music of Indonesia, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, and many others. He spent half a year in a remote village in northern Bali, conducting field research and training under master musicians I Made Terip and I Putu Putrawan and was a member of Sekar Jaya, a world-renowned Gamelan ensemble, playing in their Gong Kebyar, Anklung, Joged and Jegog ensembles. Other musicians William has studied under include Randy Gloss, I Nyoman Wenten, Andrew Grueschow, Houman Pourmehdi, Alfred Ladzekpo, Damascus Kafumbe, Dr. Michael Bakan and Dr. Frank Gunderson.\n\nAdditionally, William directs music workshops for students with autism and other developmental differences through Youth In Arts, a leading arts education non-profit organization.\n\nWilliam is the inventor of the Tihai Clock, a mechanical means of completely representing the many rhythmic cadences of Hindustani music, known as tihai. He lives in San Anselmo, California where he teaches Tabla privately.",

      "performer": "Tony McManus",
      "description": "Hailed by John Renbourn as ’the best Celtic guitarist in the world’ Tony McManus will grace the JCA Stage Tuesday evening Sept 13th at 8pm",
      "details": "“Tonys music is beyond beautiful… its perfect” ~Tommy Emmanuel\n\n[Tony McManus](https://tonymcmanus.com) has also been listed as one of the 50 transcendent guitarists of all time by Guitar Player Magazine. Tony has both extended and transcended the parameters of contemporary Celtic music. Ranked by peers and predecessors alike alongside the guitar world’s all-time greats, his fiendishly dexterous, dazzlingly original playing draws on traditions from the entire Celtic world, along with still further-ranging flavours such as jazz and eastern European music. Long applauded for his uncanny ability to transpose the delicate, complex ornamentation characteristic of traditional bagpipe or fiddle tunes – even the phrasing of a Gaelic song – onto his own six strings, McManus is increasingly being acknowledged also as a pioneering figure in bridging the realms of Celtic music and other guitar genres.\n\nBorn in 1965 in Paisley, near Glasgow, McManus was introduced to traditional music via the family record collection. Having first tried his hand at the fiddle, whistle and mandolin, he took up the guitar aged ten, although subsequent academic inclinations got him halfway through a PhD in maths before the music won out. After rapidly making his name as an unusually fluent and sensitive accompanist, he took the solo plunge with a triumphant main-stage debut on the final night of Glasgow’s inaugural Celtic Connections festival in 1994, supporting Capercaillie in front of a 2500-strong crowd.\n\nWith the loyal support of Greentrax Recordings in Scotland Tony’s first self-titled recording in 1996, followed by Pourquoi Quebec in 1999 led to worldwide recognition. However, it was with the release of Ceol More in 2002 that Tony’s stature as a first-class musician reached a new level. Having heard his session work on several albums, Nashville based Compass Records released “Ceol More” in North America to universally ecstatic reviews. Critics hailed the focused, spell-binding nature of the music, from the plaintive Jewish hymn “Shalom Aleichem” to the ingenious arrangement of the Charles Mingus tune “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat”. Having been nominated as Musician of the Year by both the BBC Folk Awards and The Scottish Traditional Music awards, in 2002 “Ceol More” hit the Critic’s Album of the year list in Acoustic Guitar magazine and was named Live Ireland Awards' Album of the Year.\n\nIn a relatively short time Tony’s music has come to define a new role for the guitar in Celtic music. He has come to represent Celtic music in the guitar world, making regular appearances at guitar specific f.festivals such as the Chet Atkins Festival in Nashville; the Ellnora Guitar Festival in one of Illinois's most prestigious venues, the Krannert Center, with the likes of Pat Metheny, Kaki King, Molly Tuttle, and Steve Dawson; has appeared at Guitar Festivals in Soave and Pescantina, Italy; Frankston, Australia; Issoudun, France; Kirkmichael, Scotland; Bath and Kent, England; Bochum and Osnabruck, Germanyand has taught at five of Steve Kaufman’s Acoustic Kamps in Maryville, Tennessee. He performed at the famous Ryman Auditorium in Nashville in the “All Star Guitar Night” featuring Steve Morse, Bryan Sutton, Muriel Anderson, Béla Fleck and Victor Wooten and headlined by the legendary Les Paul. His ability to reach audiences unfamiliar with traditional music is remarkable - he is quite comfortable at predominantly classical events such as the Dundee and Derry Guitar Festivals (appearing six times between the two) and even The Bogotá International Guitar Festival where he followed virtuoso Eduardo Fernandez. He is also a signature artist for PRS Guitars in Maryland, and has performed at their venue with Carlos Santana, among others. These days Tony has a busy tour schedule, but he also authors books on Celtic guitar, and is in demand for workshops and lessons.",

(just to name a few) . During the year 2000, while in the midst of a global trek with Peter Gabriel’s WOMAD organization, that combined huge festivals with music outreach programs to poor and underprivileged communities, Pato learned that two of his sons had been shot in a drive-by shooting! He immediately put his career on hold and turned his sorrow into the impetus for community & educational initiatives that would consume the next six years of his life.\n\nPato created an organization called “Musical Connections” and in partnership the Community Safety Team, provided tuition and counseling for “at risk” young people in 16 different communities across his city of Birmingham, UK. This project was so successful that Pato was approached by the West Midlands Police Department to tackle the ongoing problem of gun crime in some of the poorest neighborhoods. Within a few years this partnership greatly reduced gun crime across the entire city and Pato was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the BBC and entered into the British Music Hall of Fame during the same year.\n\nIn 2006, after feeling that he had planted enough seeds of progress within his home community, Pato decided to relocate to Southern California and embark on the second phase of his musical journey, taking with him the years of experience in the field of Loving Service. Since then Pato has recorded many albums and collaborated with artists all over the world. His most recent albums Love Is The Greatest & The Words Of Rastafari were released on Bob Marley’s Tuff Gong Records International.\n\nPato Banton’s four-decade public presence has increasingly transcended music to convey a positive & uplifting message of global peace and love for humanity.
