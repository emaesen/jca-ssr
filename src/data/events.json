His diverse musical palette and superlative musicianship saw him fast become one of Australia’s finest studio talents, and a go-to for artists & labels domestically & abroad, his work garnering millions of worldwide streams, and credits including Gretta Ray’s ARIA Nominated Album ‘Begin To Look Around’ (EMI), and G Flip’s #1 ARIA Charting Album ‘Drummer’ (4x ARIA Nominated). Meanwhile his work on stage as Session Guitarist & Musical Director for the likes of Kingswood was presented on international tours and radio & television broadcasts across the globe.\n\n2022 saw Kyran return to his most authentic musical form as a solo artist, with a triumphant return to European and American stages alongside mentor Tommy Emmanuel, followed by a relentless tour schedule of solo concerts across Australia, Europe, and the USA, re-introducing him as one of the greatest solo guitar players on the planet. Kyran is currently completing his renaissance solo album entitled ‘Like The Night Itself’, drawing upon rich global influences, alchemised into emotive compositions, cinematic soundscapes, and virtuosic performances from the heart.\n\n\n‘I knew at that time he would be an incredible force in music…he was always received with thunderous applause and standing ovations…’\n~ Tommy Emmanuel AM\n‘likely the most influential acoustic guitar composer of his generation … publicly unsung, his pieces have shaped the progression of the art form since his emergence onto the world stage, only growing stronger through his dormancy … we’re excited to see what this master of the guitar presents in his renaissance’",

California's northernmost bluegrass band is composed of five uniquely talented musicians, all with a common yearning for that perfect sound created by acoustic instruments and human voices. Hailing from the scattered faraway realms of Siskiyou County, each bandmate contributes a unique style and perspective to the group. Diverse musical backgrounds including jazz, classical, folk, and punk rock combine into the lively, fun, intricate and precise sound of Whiskey Gulch.\n\nButcher, baker, and banjo picker **Jake Stapley** has a mastery of many instruments and a deep background in jazz music as a pianist and drummer.\n**Sam Cuenca** (mandolin) is always the first to call if you need a sideman for a gig.  He excels at vocal harmonies and wild mandolin solos, and plays the most perfect bass lines.\n**Kevin Andras** (guitar) is known for wearing out his musical friends with marathon jams.  With tireless fingers and a deep catalog of songs to sing, he keeps it going 'til the sun comes up.\n**Tristan Behm** (bass), widely known for his Sundown Poaching, holds down the groove and contributes his fine voice to the “Pretty Boys” vocal section of the group.\n**Julie May** (fiddle) has been playing since she was a little kid, touring the country with the Fiddle Kids and competing in fiddle contests.  She brings to the group a deep understanding of rhythm and melody.",

Gordie performed over 3000 concerts around the world, often touring as Eaglesmith’s opening act, learning about the music business, and leveraging his previous experience in the boxing ring (3x Golden Glove champ). Tentrees also toured with James Cotten, Mary Gauthier, Kelly Joe Phelps, Steve Poltz, and Ray Wylie Hubbard, to name a few. Jaxon was meanwhile tearing up stages from Churchill to Belfast (D.Rangers bandleader/banjo player), producing records for his indie label (Dollartone), and touring with the likes of Petunia, The Sadies, Jon Spencer, and Romi Mayes. His close relationship with lifelong musical hero and mentor Willie P. Bennett led to Haldane recording Willie’s last record, Sharpen The Plow, just prior to Bennett’s passing in 2008. Haldane founded the Willie P. Bennett Legacy site to pay tribute to his deceased friend. Interestingly, Bennett and Eaglesmith spent 25 years performing and touring, setting an example of camaraderie and excellence that still guides the way for Tentrees and Haldane. ",

      "description": "JCA is proud to welcome back The Clements Brothers! Last season, their amazing harmonies and musicality had Mt Shasta begging for more! So we are honored to welcome them back once again to the JCA. The Clements Brothers, George (guitar) and Charles (bass), combine their love of music in a rich blend of harmony and melody with original songwriting and instrumental skill.",
      "details": "#The Clements Brothers# [The Clements Brothers](https://www.theclementsbrothers.com/) are George and Charles Clements, identical twins from New England. They’ve been playing and writing music together for as long as they can remember and ‘The Clements Brothers’ marks their first project together since playing in the internationally touring grass-roots band, ‘The Lonely Heartstring Band’ with whom they put out two albums on Rounder Records. With roots, rock, bluegrass, jazz, and classical influences, George (on guitar) and Charles (on bass) aim to capture their singer-songwriter sensibilities in a unique blended voice, at once enthralling and intimate, groovy and serene. They are joined by drummer Mike Harmon, who joined the band after an impromptu late night set at the Ossipee Music festival, and adds his unique roots-conscious musicality to the group's evolving sound.  The trio is a fusion of each member's unique musical journey, and the result is music all its own, filled with vocal harmonies, instrumental virtuosity, and a genuine love of song.",
