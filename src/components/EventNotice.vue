    JCA artists often have to travel quite a distance to play in Mount Shasta.<br>If tickets aren’t purchased or reserved, we are unfortunately forced to cancel.<br>So if you are interested in coming to a show,<br><span class="emph">drop us an email or buy your tix in advance</span><br>so we can assure the artists of a nice good crowd.<br>It would help us out a-lot!

    We've been off to an AMAZING start in 2026 with two sold out shows Jason Dea West and Gareth Pearson.
    <br><span class="xbr"></span>
    We have a new outdoor fire pit and some yummy new offerings at the bar. Come see us!
    <br><span class="xbr"></span>
    <span class="emph">RESERVATIONS AVAILABLE FOR ALL SHOWS</span>
    <br><span class="xbr"></span>
    <span class="deemph">If you know you want to come (but are hesitant to buy an advance ticket online) reserve a ticket for the adv price via email and pay at the venue.
    Given that shows might sell out, we want to make sure you can get yourself a ticket!</span>
    <br><span class="xbr"></span>
    Hope to see you soon!
