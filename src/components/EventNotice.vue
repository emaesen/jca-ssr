    JCA artists often have to travel quite a distance to play in Mount Shasta.<br>If tickets arenâ€™t purchased or reserved, we are unfortunately forced to cancel.<br>So if you are interested in coming to a show,<br><span class="emph">drop us an email or buy your tix in advance</span><br>so we can assure the artists of a nice good crowd.<br>It would help us out a-lot!
