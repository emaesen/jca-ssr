    <h2>Our Facebook ‘vision’ page.</h2>
    <p>
      We're so incredibly excited to have the opportunity to provide this most amazing community in Mount Shasta with a venue to celebrate the Arts!!!
    </p>
    <p class="emph">
      The JCA would like to ask everyone to please help us spread the word by ‘liking /following’ us on Facebook, and sharing our vision with others who would be just as excited about it as we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're a community-based operation and we simply couldn't create the magic unless you were involved!
